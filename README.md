# GCTides

A way to get NOAA tide predictions as Google Calendar events

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Components

-   GCTides.R, a script with simple code to convert tide tables from NOAA's Tides and Currents to a csv importable by Google Calendar. May eventually be set up as a function.

-   8413079_annual.txt, the table of Winter Harbor, ME annual predictions from NOAA Tides and Currents, serves as an example input.

-   GCTidesWinterHarborME2024.csv, exported csv that can be imported into a Google Calendar, serves as an example output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Requirements

-   R and Tidyverse (particularly packages dplyr, readr, and lubridate)

-   The txt file of exported tide predictions from NOAA Tides and Currents

-   Google Calendar
